# Sudoku-Solver
A simple sudoku solver using BackTracking. The actual functions are implemented in both cpp and python (with cpp also including
an oops Implementation). 
The GUI However needs work. For now you can still use the gui but it's not with any unique features.

## GUI

The GUI is written in pygame. The gui needs the python implementaion as a dependency.

### Using the GUI:
  The GUI ( for now ) works in a very non-intuitive way. You need to press the key before hand and the press the square you
want to insert the number in. On a wrong entry you will see a messages on the command line saying 'Wrong' and on a correct
entry the gui is updated with the correct/inserted answer. 

### Features of GUI:
1. When spacebar is pressed, the gui displays all the correct answers. 


### Plans:
1. To improve change the spacebar feature and to make sure that the gui shows all the previously filled correct answer in a 
green outline and the wrong ones with a red outline.
